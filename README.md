## Introduction
In this project, we perform an EDA on the film industry dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the industry. We analyze factors such as movie genres, budgets, box office performance, and more.

## Data Collection
We collected the film industry dataset from reliable sources, including movie databases and industry reports. The dataset contains information about movies released over the years, including details such as release date, genre, budget, box office revenue, and more.

## Data Cleaning
Before conducting the analysis, we performed data cleaning to ensure the dataset is accurate and consistent. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the data format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA phase involved analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables. We used various visualizations, statistical techniques, and data manipulation to gain insights into the film industry.

## Conclusion
Based on our analysis, we draw conclusions about the film industry, including the most popular genres, best rated directors and writers, and other interesting findings. This EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the film industry and can be used for further analysis or decision-making.

Please refer to the `index.ipynb` notebook for a detailed analysis and code implementation.
